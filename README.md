# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction-Using-CNN-and-Clinical-Features
📌 Overview  This project presents a hybrid Alzheimer’s disease prediction model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with clinical features to improve diagnostic accuracy. The primary objective is to reduce false positives and false negatives commonly observed when relying solely on imaging-based CNN models.
